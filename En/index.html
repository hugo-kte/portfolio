                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Hugo Kothe</strong>, born on September 7, 2003, in Chambray-lès-Tours.
                    Passionate about technology, science, and combat sports, my journey is a constant exploration
                    of the fields that inspire and challenge me.

                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">My Journey: From Curiosity to Passion</h2>
                <p>
                    From my childhood in Véretz, a small town in Touraine, I developed a dual fascination: 
                    on one hand, for combat sports and martial arts, which taught me discipline and perseverance; 
                    on the other, for everyday objects, which I would dismantle to understand how they worked. 
                    This insatiable curiosity led me to discover electronics, and later, computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In middle school, my passion for computer systems intensified when I began exploring
                    cybersecurity in my own way: bypassing school restrictions or creating small programs to entertain my friends. 
                    These early experiences allowed me to develop an intuitive understanding of systems and networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I chose the NSI (Digital and Computer Science) option in my first year, a natural choice that confirmed my ambition
                    to pursue a career in new technologies. Alongside, inspirations like the videos of ici amy-plant at École 42 or the series Mr. Robot further fueled my fascination for IT.

                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">ESIEE Paris: A Strategic Decision</h2>
                <p>
                    Joining ESIEE Paris in 2019 was a decisive step. I left my hometown for Paris with the goal of enrolling in a prestigious school,
                    where I could combine my interest in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. This adventure opened up immense opportunities
                    and allowed me to consolidate my technical skills while broadening my view of the professional world.

                <h3>Chez BOB</h3>
                <p>
                    As a kitchen assistant, I learned to manage stress in a professional environment and to work as part of a team. I also had the opportunity to lead new employees, which helped me develop my communication and leadership skills.
                </p>
            
                <h3>La Campagnarde</h3>
                <p>
                    Working as a pastry chef, I refined my techniques while supervising and training new staff. During peak periods, I also contributed to sales, thereby enhancing my versatility.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Coloria</h3>
                <p>
                    In this academic project, I designed and developed the entire web component, including both client and server. My work involved creating an intuitive user interface and a high-performance backend, while integrating the artificial intelligence models provided by my teammates.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Facial Recognition</h3>
                <p>
                    We developed a model capable of detecting and identifying faces with precision using advanced computer vision techniques. This project helped me understand the challenges of facial encoding and further strengthened my knowledge in applied AI.
                </p>
