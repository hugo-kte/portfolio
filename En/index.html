                <p>
                    Hi, I'm <strong>Hugo Kothe</strong>, born on September 7, 2003, in Chambray-lès-Tours.
                    I'm passionate about technology, science, and combat sports. My journey has always been about exploring,
                    learning, and pushing my limits.
                </p>

            <section id="journey">
                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">My Journey: From Curiosity to Passion</h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up in Véretz, a small town in Touraine, I developed two major passions: combat sports, which taught me discipline and resilience, and a fascination for how things work. I loved taking apart everyday objects just to understand their mechanisms. This curiosity naturally led me to discover electronics and, later, computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In middle school, I got hooked on computer systems. I started exploring cybersecurity in my own way—bypassing school restrictions and creating small programs to entertain my friends. These early experiences built a strong, intuitive understanding of systems and networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I chose the NSI (Digital and Computer Science) option. It was a perfect fit and confirmed my desire to pursue a tech career. Around that time, I drew inspiration from Amy Plant's videos about École 42 and the *Mr. Robot* series, which further fueled my fascination with the digital world.

            <section id="esiee">
                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">ESIEE Paris: A Key Milestone</h2>
                <p>
                    Joining ESIEE Paris in 2019 was a game-changer. I moved to Paris with a clear goal: to study at a top school where I could dive into artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. This journey has not only sharpened my technical skills but also broadened my understanding of the professional world.

                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Key Experiences and Projects</h2>

                <h3>Chez BOB</h3>
                <p>
                    Working as a kitchen assistant taught me how to handle pressure and collaborate with a team. I also got to train new employees, which helped me build strong leadership and communication skills.
                </p>

                <h3>La Campagnarde</h3>
                <p>
                    As a pastry chef, I honed my craft while supervising and training new staff. I also handled sales during busy periods, improving my adaptability and multitasking abilities.
                </p>

                <h3>Coloria</h3>
                <p>
                    For this academic project, I developed the entire web platform, from front-end to back-end. My focus was on creating a user-friendly interface and a solid backend while integrating AI models provided by my teammates.
                </p>

                <h3>Facial Recognition</h3>
                <p>
                    We built a facial recognition model using advanced computer vision techniques. This project gave me hands-on experience with facial encoding challenges and strengthened my applied AI knowledge.
